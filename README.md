# Julia Learning Materials for Beginners

This repository contains beginner-friendly materials to help you get started with Julia programming.
## Contents

### Creating Arrays in Julia (`Creating Arrays in Julia.jl`)
Learn the basics of constructing, indexing, and working with arrays in Julia, covering both vectors and matrices.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (`Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.jl`)
Explore how to use Julia's Linear Algebra package to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Functions in Julia (`Function.jl`)
Understand the essentials of defining functions in Julia with practice problems.

### Importing Data and Basic Linear Regression (`OLS Regression in Julia.jl`)

Learn how to import data and perform a basic linear regression in Julia using the automobile dataset from STATA.
A CSV version of the dataset (`auto.csv`) is available in this repository for convenience. 
Alternatively, you can download the original data from [STATA's official site](https://www.stata-press.com/data/r9/u.html).
To replicate the results, simply run `OLS Regression in Julia.jl`. This should yield the same coefficients displayed in `results_from_stata.png`.
